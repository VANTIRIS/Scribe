Took the morning to mess around with Opus 4.6.

My go-to model eval is always the same. I ask for a one-shot browser-based STEP viewer + tolerancing/markup app.

This is what I constantly beg every US based online manufacturer to offer. I believe it will be a game changer for the industry. Everyone hates parsing paper drawings and prefers blanket .005 tolerances. Go a tiny bit further and have the users code a few faces. There's a nugget of the future in this approach. Probably half stupid and of course inappropriate for some types of parts. But it has the taste of the future. 

Anyway, I digress. 

Basically a PDF equivalent for CAD. Turn a STEP file into a traveling source of truth by layering metadata onto face IDs. Colors, threads, tolerances, notes, whatever. The model isn’t the CAD file anymore, the STEP + its annotations are.

Of course it’s never actually one-shot. It’s an hour of back and forth. Tight loop. Tiny spec changes. “No, not like that, like this.” I run the same test on every new GPT/Claude release.

I’m still not sure I’m good at programming, I just know how to ask for things clearly, write specs that don’t leak ambiguity, and iterate like a maniac until the thing works. Manifest the idea into existence, which then becomes the spec for the next iteration. 

Humans are awful at defining requirements upfront. You manifest the idea into something real, then that artifact becomes the spec for the next loop.

This feels like the primary skill of the future. It’s project management, but hyper-accelerated. Micro-management. Pico-management. A level of iteration speed you could never ethically apply to humans. 

And I’m slowly realizing the harness isn’t for the model. It’s for me. I’m the bottleneck. The model can sprint forever, I’m the one that runs out of clarity.

Anyway, this is a throwaway idea. Maybe some YC kids will raise on it. Whatever, ideas are cheap, this took an hour.
