## 📋 What is Scribe?

Scribe is a simple tool designed to help you add notes and highlights to STEP files. STEP files are a common format used in 3D modeling and CAD software to share designs. If you work with these files or just want to review and annotate them without complicated software, Scribe makes that process easy and straightforward.

This tool uses a modern, user-friendly design that lets you open STEP files, mark specific areas, add comments, and save your changes. You don’t need any programming skills or special CAD knowledge to use Scribe.
